Game:

1. e4 nf6
2. e5 ng8
3. e6


The following things occur:

1) On 1. ... nf6, the client never receives an "ack" from lila-ws, causing the client to retry sending the message indefinitely.

2) After 3. e6 the client retries cause a duplicate message of 1. ... nf6 to arrives server-side.
   Because 3. ... nf6 would be a valid move, lila applies it as ply 6 to in the GameProxy in-memory cache.

3) The ClientIn.RoundVersion messages for 3. ... nf6 are lost in transit before the clients receive them.

4) On the next scheduled flush of GameProxy state to mongodb, containing the move 3. ... nf6, the mongo write fails.

Expected behavior: after time runs out, White should win since White made the last recorded move.

Actual behavior: Black wins on time.
